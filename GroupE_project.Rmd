# Problem statement

The dataset contains the data of the clients of an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance. Our goal is to analyze the relationship between the features and the probability of the customers buying a vehicle insurance. Now, in order to predict whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, we have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy ins(Premium, sourcing channel) etc.

Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers. Now they need the help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from the past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue.

# Data

We had three datasets to analyze 'train.csv', 'test.csv' and 'sample.csv'. Among these datasets we only analyzed the first one. The 'test.csv' dataset lacked the 'Response' variable and the 'sample.csv' file contained observations of this variable but one for one category, making them unusable.

Our dataset is composed of the following variables:

| Variable             | Definition                                                                                                                  | Type        |

| Age                  | Age of the customer                                                                                                         | Numeric     |

| Region_Code          | Unique code for the region of the customer                                                                                  | Categorical |

| Vehicle_Age          | Age of the Vehicle                                                                                                          | Categorical |
| Vehicle_Damage       | 1 : Customer got his/her vehicle damaged in the past. 0 : Customer didn't get his/her vehicle damaged in the past.          | Binary      |
| Annual_Premium       | The amount customer needs to pay as premium in the year                                                                     | Numeric     |
| Policy_Sales_Channel | Anonymized Code for the channel of outreaching to the customer ie. Different Agents, Over Mail, Over Phone, In Person, etc. | Categorical |
| Vintage              | Number of Days, Customer has been associated with the company                                                               | Numeric     |
| Response             | 1 : Customer is interested, 0 : Customer is not interested                                                                  | Binary      |

The first step is trying to get some insights about the dataset by plotting and analyzing the data. We present the barplots for the categorical variables and the density plots for the numerical ones.

The 'id' variable is just a discrete ordered variable with uniform distribution. Therefore, we just removed it from our analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 'Response' variable

The proportion for the categories of the response variable are the following:

```{r}
# Pie chart of Response variable with percentages of the total observations. 
# Calculate the percentages
response_counts <- table(train_reduced$Response)
response_props <- round(prop.table(response_counts) * 100, 2)

# Create a data frame for the pie chart
pie_data <- data.frame(
  Response = factor(names(response_counts), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
  Count = as.numeric(response_counts),
  Label = paste0(response_props, "%")
)

# Create the pie chart
p0 <- ggplot(pie_data, aes(x = "", y = Count, fill = Response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  labs(x = "", y = "", fill = "Interest in Car Insurance") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12), 
    text = element_text(size = 12)
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(y = Count / 2, label = Label),
    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.9),
    size = 8
  ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("No", "Yes"))
p0
```

As we can see the dataset is unbalanced and the imbalance ratio is:

```{r}
props <- table(train_reduced$Response)
IR<-as.numeric(props[1]/props[2])
sprintf("IR: %f", IR)
```

This degree of imbalance is considered to be weak with respect to the reference level of 10 for slight imbalance, thus we decided to not perform any procedure to correct the imbalance.

### Numerical variables

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=15}
p2 <- ggpairs(train_reduced, 
              columns = c("Age", "Annual_Premium", "Vintage"),
              aes(color = Response),
              diag = list(discrete="barDiag", 
                          continuous = wrap("densityDiag", alpha=0.7)))
p2
```

The distribution of the Age variable with respect to the Response variable shows that the majority of the customers who are interested in car insurance are middle-aged (between 30 and 60 years old), which coincides with the age people are more likely to own a car. The customers not interested in acquiring a car insurance policy are mostly distributed among younger people and some middle-aged adults in their 50s. The ditribution is skewed to the right.

The plot for Annual Premium suggests that the costs of the car insurance policy is independent of the interest if the customers to buy the product. It has a highly right-skewed distribution, with most of the data concentrated on the lower end of the premium scale and a long tail extending to higher premium values. The lower tail shows a high values as a consequence of entry level health insurance policy as expected.

Since both Age and Annual Premium are skewed to the right, we considered to apply a logarithm transformation for both the variables.

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=15}
train_reduced$logAge <- log(train_reduced$Age)
train_reduced$logAnnual_Premium <- log(train_reduced$Annual_Premium)
p3 <- ggpairs(train_reduced, 
              columns = c("logAge", "logAnnual_Premium"),
              aes(color = Response),
              diag = list(discrete="barDiag", 
                continuous = wrap("densityDiag", alpha=0.7 )))
p3
```

The plot for Vintage shows a nearly uniform distribution, with a slight increase in frequency towards the middle range of the Vintage variable. It may not be significant in the explanation of the Response.

The variables show negligible linear correlation between them, which is clearly shown in the scatter plot and in the correlation coefficients.

### Categorical variables

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=9}
p9 <- ggplot(train_reduced, aes(x = Region_Code, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(y = "Count", fill = "Response") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 10)]) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  )


p14 <- ggplot(train_reduced, aes(x = Policy_Sales_Channel, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(y = "Count", fill = "Response") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 20)]) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  )
p_cat <- p9 + p14
p_cat##Should be clearer
```

Regarding the variable Region_Code, we can notice that the vast majority of the customers are from region 28. The customers from region 28 are also the ones who are most interested in car insurance. Almost half of the customers are distributed among regions 8, 28, 41, 46 accounting for \~47% of the total customers. Since this variable has a lot of labels with low frequency, we decided to consider only the major four ones mentioned above and an additional one with the remaining labels as a unique category.

Also in Policy_Sales_Channel, there are four categories more frequent than others: Channels 26, 124, 152 and 160 alone account for more than 80% of the customers. Channels 26 and 124 are the ones with the highest percentage of customers interested in the product. Only about 20% of the customers interested in the product are distributed in the rest of the channels of outreach. As we did for Region_Code, we grouped the remaining less frequent categories as one.

After the grouping:

```{r}
p10 <- ggplot(train_reduced, aes(x = Region_Reduced, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(y = "Count", fill = "Response") +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  ) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE)
p15 <- ggplot(train_reduced, aes(x = Channels_Reduced, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  labs(y = "Count", fill = "Response") +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  ) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE)
p10+p15
```

Gender...

```{r}
p7 <- ggplot(train_reduced, aes(x = Gender, fill = Response)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "black") +
  labs(y = "Percentage", fill = "Response") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14)
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)

p7
```

The last categorical variable is ID, which we won't consider for models, since it is a simple identifier of the customers. Hence it doesn't give any more information about the Response.

# MODELS

After exploring the data, now we proceed with the fitting and assessment of different models for binary classification. For training and testing the models we performed a static train/test split with 70% of train set and 30% of test set.

Il nostro scopo Ã¨ capire quali variabili utilizzare e come utilizzarle. -nested models statico con assessment -stepAIC() con assessment -rifare tutto con log?? oppure ne facciamo 2 in parallelo

In order to understand which variables are more significant in the explanation of the response variable, we analyzed nested models with different combinations of selected explanatory variables.

## stepAIC

The first approach we used consists of using the function stepAIC() from the MASS package to find the best combination of predictors with respect to AIC. The stepAIC() function must be applied to the full model, which serves as the starting point for the variable selection process. We chose the 'both' direction, that considers both adding and removing variables from the model.

```{r}
# Drop columns Policy_Sales_Channel and Region_Code from unbalanced_train
unbalanced_train <- unbalanced_train[, !names(unbalanced_train) %in% c("Policy_Sales_Channel", "Region_Code")]

# Drop columns Policy_Sales_Channel and Region_Code from unbalanced_test
unbalanced_test <- unbalanced_test[, !names(unbalanced_test) %in% c("Policy_Sales_Channel", "Region_Code")]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
full_model <- glm(Response ~ Gender + Age + Driving_License + Previously_Insured + 
    Vehicle_Age + Vehicle_Damage + Annual_Premium + Vintage + 
    Channels_Reduced + Region_Reduced, data = unbalanced_train, family = binomial)
stepAIC(full_model, direction = 'both')
```

Performing the stepAIC function we can see that, as previously said, the variable Vintage is not useful for the model, since its almost uniform distribution. The stepAIC function stops when the ranking of models built by removing and adding one variable at a time has an AIC greater than the default model. Hence, this procedure doesn't allow us to obtain a simple model based on the Occam's razor. Consequentially we also implemented a procedure to obtain a reduced model based on idea of the stepAIC.

This procedure builds a ranking of variables, similar to the one of the stepAIC, meaning to create models by removing one variable at a time and sorting the variables by AIC. After that, we built nested models by adding one variable at a time based on the ranking of variables mentioned before.

```{bash}

Start:  AIC=144269.1
Response ~ Gender + Age + Driving_License + Previously_Insured + 
    Vehicle_Age + Vehicle_Damage + Annual_Premium + Vintage + 
    Channels_Reduced + Region_Reduced

summary(best_model)
```

```{r}
exp(best_model$coefficients) 
```

These results suggest that:
 
* Male customers are 9% more interested in car insurance than female customers.
 
* There is a slight decrease in the odds of interest in the product with each year of increasing customer age. 

* Customers with a driver's license are 3 times more interested in the product than those without a driver's license.
 
* There is a dramatic decrease in the interest of the customers in the product for those who previously had their cars insured. The company should focus on improving its services because current policyholders lose their interest by 98% with respect to those without car insurance.
 
* The results show that customers with older cars show more interest than customers with new cars. Around 2 times for cars more than 2 years old compared to new cars.
 
* The interest in the Car Insurance Policy of the customers with health insurance who had their car damaged in the past is more than 7 times that of those who havenÂ´t. This is expected and a variable the company should focus on to estimate the risk associated with these customers.
 
* The amount the customer needs to pay as a premium in the year doesn't seem to be associated with any increase or decrease in the odds of the event.
 
* There is more interest in the product, from ~14% to ~54% more interest, for customers from Regions 28, 41, 46, and 0 (combination of low frequent regions) with respect to Region 8.  
 
* The outreach Channel 26 (base category in the model) gets from 16% to 90% more interested customers in comparison with Channel 26. Channel 124 attracts a lot of clients as well and the company could attempt to increase its influence in this channel.
 
* The variable Vintage (number of days the customers have been associated with the company) was completely removed from the model because of low significance with respect to the AIC.

## Nested models

The first approach consists of adding variables one by one, starting from an empty model and proceeding until all the variables considered in the model. ##Comparison and model selection

#*RUN THE MODEL

```{r}
result_glm <- ranking_nested_models(unbalanced_train, unbalanced_test, use_model = "glm", use_log = FALSE, use_splines = FALSE)
```

```{r}
result_glm
```

Anova

```{r}

# Perform ANOVA

anova_values <- anova(result_glm$Models$Vintage, test = "Chisq")
anova_values
```

Observing the AIC and the anova test we noticed that there is not a significant decrease in the AIC or a significant improvement in deviance in the last three models, hence we decided to consider the nested model up to Region_Reduced.

```{r}
summary(result_glm$Models$Region_Reduced)
```

As we can see from the summary, all the variables have a p-value close to 0, hence they are all statistically significant

```{r}
result_glm_log <- ranking_nested_models(unbalanced_train, unbalanced_test, use_model = "glm", use_log = TRUE, use_splines = FALSE)
result_glm_log
```


This analysis shows that the best AIC in the model with the logarithm is worse than the model we chose for the glm without logarithm, hence we decided not to include the logarithm.

Trying to fit the model with gam and adding a spline for Age variable, we noticed that not only the AIC improves, but the expected degrees of freedom for the Age are significantly high, hence, so far, the best model seems to be the one using gam with splines on Age.

```{r}
library(arm)
# Get predicted values from the model
predicted_values <- predict(result_glm$Models$Region_Reduced, unbalanced_test, type = "response", threshold = result_glm$Results$Threshold[5])
 #?predict
# Calculate residuals
residuals <- residuals(result_glm$Models$Region_Reduced, type = "deviance", threshold = result_glm$Results$Threshold[5])
 
# Take the indexes for the predictions with probabiliies greater or equal than the optimal threshold
#best_model_indexes <- predicted_values >= 0.14
 
# Plot the binned residuals
arm::binnedplot(predicted_values[best_model_indexes], residuals[best_model_indexes])
```


### The best overall

---plots of the gcVIZ library---

```{r}
# select the commands that actually convey relevant information
gam_sampledViz <- getViz(gam_sampled)
print(plot(gam_sampledViz, allTerms = T), pages = 1)
plot(gam_sampledViz)

pl <- plot(gam_sampledViz, allTerms = T) + l_points() + l_fitLine(linetype = 3) + l_fitContour() + 
      l_ciLine(colour = 2) + l_ciBar() + l_fitPoints(size = 1, col = 2) + theme_get() + labs(title = NULL) #+ 
      # l_dens(type = "cond")
print(pl, pages = 1)
```

#### Binned residuals, VIF, Anova

---for anova and vif we only need to compute that for the best model or the full model---

```{r}
vif(result_glm$Models$Driving_License)
```

Through the vif function we can see that there is no sign of multicolinearity, since the variance inflation factors are very small for every variable.

Select one of the two blocks of code below

```{r}
library(arm)

# Get predicted values from the model
predicted_values <- predict(model, test_data, type = "response")

# Calculate residuals
residuals <- residuals(model, type = "deviance")

# Create partial residual plots for each predictor variable
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  # Adjust the layout based on the number of predictor variables

for (var in colnames(test_data)) {
  if (var != "response") {
    partial_residuals <- residuals(model, type = "partial", terms = var)
    
    # Plot partial residuals
    plot(
      test_data[[var]], 
      partial_residuals,
      type = "p",
      xlab = var,
      ylab = "Partial Residuals",
      main = paste("Partial Residual Plot for", var)
    )
    
    # Calculate and plot binned residuals
    binned_residuals <- binned.resids(test_data[[var]], partial_residuals, nclass = 10)
    
    plot(
      binned_residuals$binned[, "xbar"],

      ylim = c(-2, 2)
    )
  }
}

# Reset plotting parameters

```

or

```{r}

#### Coefficients

## RF

Due to our limited computational resources, we had to sample our dataset in order to fit a random forest model with 500 trees.

```{r}
sample <- unbalanced_train[sample(nrow(unbalanced_train), nrow(unbalanced_train)*0.6, replace = FALSE),]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(randomForest)
model_rf <- randomForest(Response ~ ., data = sample, importance = TRUE, ntree = 500)
print(model_rf)
```

```{bash}
Call:
 randomForest(formula = Response ~ ., data = sample, importance = TRUE,      ntree = 500) 
               Type of random forest: classification

We can notice that the class error for the Yes category is very high, therefore we decided to use a threshold in order to avoid misclassification.

```{r}
# Predict probabilities
probabilities <- predict(model_rf, newdata = subset(unbalanced_test, select = -Response), type = "prob")[, "Yes"]
 
# Compute ROC curve
roc_curve <- roc(unbalanced_test$Response, probabilities)
 
# Calculate AUC
auc_score <- auc(roc_curve)
 
# Find optimal threshold using Youden's J statistic
youdens_j <- coords(roc_curve, "best", best.method = "youden")
optimal_threshold <- youdens_j$threshold
 
# Plot the ROC curve using plot.roc from the pROC package
plot.roc(roc_curve, col = "blue", main = "ROC Curve", lwd = 2)
 
# Add a point for the best threshold
points(youdens_j$specificity, youdens_j$sensitivity, pch = 19, col = "red")
 
# Adding a legend or text to mark the point
text(youdens_j$specificity, youdens_j$sensitivity, labels = paste("Threshold:", round(optimal_threshold, 2)), pos = 4)
 
# Add labels and legend
abline(h = 0, v = 1, lty = 2, col = "gray")
legend("topright", legend = paste("AUC =", round(auc(roc_curve), 2)), col = "blue", lwd = 2)

# Final conclusions

(skim)We observe that there are not missing values and that the Response variable has an imbalance rate of 7.15 (put code) so we don't need to act to fix that.
